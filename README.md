## USE:
To use an extension first you have to go to chrome extensions and download the respective extension you want to use 
and to set it at the top of your browser just click on the button that appears to the right and it will position 
itself there.
Once installed, with the mouse, go to the top of your browser and click on the logo this will display a start menu 
where you will have a title and a color code by default.
To see the extension you have to click on the coloar square or on its code, this will deploy a menu where you will 
see a fan of colors in the middle part and in the inferior part a logo, some initials and some arrows.
To use the extension you have to click on the black logo and a course with zoom will unfold where the pixel in the 
center of the circle will be taken as a reference to extract the color and its code.
Once you click on your chosen color, automatically the extension will return the color with its code in RGB (this 
extension has RGB-HSL&HEX code) if you want to see the color code in another style, just click on the arrows and 
they will change the code.
